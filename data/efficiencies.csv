Assume losses in downstream processes have (worst case) from a climate perspective the same impact as using the methane for 
energy by means of combustion.
Approach: Calculate CO2-eq emissions for 1 MWh from burning CH4 (LHV) (=198 kg CO2) and determine amount of CH4 which has to leak to have the same CO2-eq effect (=2.357 kg CH4, assuming GWP-20 of 84 for CH4; = 32.74 kWh_LHV,CH4). The ratio between this amount of CH4 and the amount of CH4 required for 1 MWh from burning is then the maximum leakage rate.
Similar numbers are reported e.g. here: https://www.energyvoice.com/otherenergy/207433/wave-of-drones-and-cameras-to-help-bp-snuff-out-methane-leaks/.
